    <h1>What is Gungi?</h1>
    <p>
      Gungi is a two-player strategy board game created by Yoshihiro Togashi and is featured in the in the popular manga
      <a href="https://hunterxhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter" class="sc-dQppl cQZIoF">Hunter x Hunter</a>.

      It is played on a non-checkered game board with 81 squares arranged in a 9x9 grid. At the beginning of the game,
      players can choose how their pieces will be arranged on their side of the board.

      Additionally, unlike its spiritual brethren, chess, shogi, and go, in Gungi pieces can be stacked on top of each
      other, adding a third dimension to the game leading to billions and billions of possibilities. As in chess and
      shogi, the goal is to trap the king.

    <h1>Rules of Gameplay</h1>
    <div>Visit the link to the <a
        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/6803yz/revised_rules_of_gungi_in_hunterxhunter_pdf/">
        original reddit post</a>
      which details the ruleset for Gungi and was the main inspiration for this website.
      <ol>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Each player is provided a total of 38 pieces as enumerated above.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">In the draft phase, pieces are put on the board in the first three rows,
          trading off one-by-one. Black places first. The Marshal must always be put first.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The minimum pieces that must be placed in the beginning is one. This piece
          must be the Marshal. The maximum number of pieces you can have on the board at any time is 26.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">White takes the first turn after all pieces have been set up and the game
          phase begins.</li>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">A turn can be used for one of four things:<ol
            style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Move – choose one piece to move (see section above on how pieces move);
              remember that towers themselves do not move, they only increase range of mobility of the top piece</li>
            <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Attack – if an enemy piece occupies a square within your range of
              movement, you can attack; if there is only one piece, your piece must then move into and occupy that
              square but if you’re attacking a tower, the result is that the tower loses the top and your piece now
              controls it</li>
            <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Stack – if either a friendly piece or an enemy piece is within your range
              of movement, you can stack on top of that piece to form a tower (the top piece of the tower controls the
              tower regardless of pieces of a different team below it)</li>
            <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Place – if you have less than the maximum pieces on the board, you may
              take a piece from your remaining pieces (captured pieces cannot be used) and place it anywhere on the
              board with following exceptions:<ol>
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Multiple pawns cannot be placed in the same file</li>
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Pawns cannot place the opposing Marshal into check mate (although
                  check is allowed)</li>
                <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Pieces cannot be placed within the first three ranks of the opposing
                  team’s side of the board</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The game concludes when the Marshal is mated. The player who checkmates their
          opponent wins. If a player at any given point has no legal moves to make and is not currently in check then a
          stalemate occurs and the game is a tie. Alternatively, the game may end if one side forfeits during the game.
        </li>
      </ol>
